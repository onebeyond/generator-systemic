# GENERATOR-SYSTEMIC

> A generator for a systemic microservice.


### Systemic microservice

An easy and unopinionated implementation of a microservice fostering an inner [Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)).

#### Main concepts
- [__Systemic__](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systemic): dependecy injection orchestrator in charge of correctly start and stop the different components of the microservice.
- __Systemic microservice__: a system composed of different sub-systems --> _components_ and _sub-components_.
- __Components__ and __sub-components__: minimal responsability elements (Adapters) of the system in charge of dealing with a given Port (generally speaking).


# INSTALLATION

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-systemic using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-systemic
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

 * Yeoman has a heart of gold.
 * Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
 * Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
 * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).


# USAGE

### Default

Generate your new systemic project: a white canvas into which create the components you do prefer according to your specifi business logic.

[More info](generators/app/templates/root/_README.md)

```bash
mkdir my-service
cd my-service
yo systemic
```

### Advanced

Generate your new systemic project with extra components: a not so white canvas with a given business logic already in place to help you better understand how to handle components (and sub-components):
- versioning.
- workflows.
- testing.
- systemic ecosystem npm handy modules (e.g. [systemic-rabbitmq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systemic-rabbitmq) - [systemic-mongdb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systemic-mongodb)).

[More info](generators/advanced/templates/root/_README.md)

```bash
mkdir my-service
cd my-service

```
